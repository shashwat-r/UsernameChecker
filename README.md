# UsernameChecker

It is often the case that people have to create a handle/profile on multiple websites, and want to create a single handle to represent themselves on all websites.

Doing this process manually becomes very tiresome very quickly. Hence this project gives the availability status of a given username on multiple websites.

This will help the users find a curated username for themselves with ease.

## Installation

You can install this project using golang's standard `go get` command.
```
$ go get -u github.com/shashwat-r/UsernameChecker
```

## Usage

Navigate to the project directory `$GOPATH/src/github.com/shashwat-r/UsernameChecker` and run the commands.
```
$ go build
$ ./UsernameChecker
```
This would open your application on the address `localhost:8080`.

That's it. You can try out different usernames in the search bar now. Enjoy!
